==================================================

Meeting: Standup — Week 7
Date: Monday, November 11
Time: 6:20pm - 7:00pm
Location: Remote (Discord)

Attendees:
- Jared
- Noe
- Anthony
- Eli
- Jeff
Note: All members present!

==================================================

Standup Format:

Yesterday / Last Worked On:
- Jared: Reviewed Anthony’s game physics PR, streak feature implemented & merged, began UI refactor (cleaned up logic and main menu so far).
- Noe: Built auto-pause when clicking off tab/window, PR reviewed by Anthony. Fixing post-race finish screen (WIP). Reviewed Anthony’s camera changes, worked on campaign mode & separate campaign button. Noted laps feel slow (consider increasing accel/velocity).
- Anthony: Rescaled track for smoother path calculations, reviewed & refactored Sprint 1 code into MVC, fixed keyboard listeners staying active during pause, built lane system (dynamic lane count via JSON), implemented new camera controller with self-correcting rotation, improved collision & lane-changing logic.
- Eli: Working on pitstop minigame (PR out, needs review). UI complete, implementing logic for pitstop trigger after X attempts, overlay activation, and progression bars.
- Jeff: Updated HUD UI to match design, created meetings folder + 3 templates, completed sprint planning notes and took live standup notes, 50% completion on minimap.

Today / Working On Next:
- Jared: Continue refactor for UI changes.
- Noe: Continue finish screen fix, tune track feel (accel/velocity), continue campaign implementation.
- Anthony: Begin bot AI logic (random answer timing, human-like correctness, bot difficulty stats).
- Eli: Implement pitstop logic (overlay, progress bars, entry/exit flow).
- Jeff: Finish minimap renderer + functionality + tests; implement race finish/lap line on track.

Blockers / Needs Help:
- Eli: Needs pitstop PR reviewed.
- Noe: Needs help debugging finish screen soon if not resolved.
- Jeff: None at the moment, but will request review when minimap PR is ready.

==================================================

Team Notes:
- PR Reviews to be completed by tomorrow.
- Finish screen must be completed by tomorrow (Noe).

Pitstop Discussion:
- Acts as a separate new lane segment on track (not appearing only when fuel is low).
- Player/bot should be able to enter ≥ 1 time per race (team leaning toward multiple allowed).
- When entering pitstop:
  - Car halts → overlay minigame appears.
  - Answer question challenges to fill 1–3 progress bars (fuel, tires, etc).
  - Bars decay if not filled, correct answers boost progress.
  - Once complete → boosted exit back into the race.
- Overlay should feel like a true minigame (not core gameplay reuse).
- Jared emphasized creating pitstop state tracking (player/bot) to enforce rules.
- Eli working on overlay where race is background + minigame UI on top.
- Eli is open to adjusting pitstop trigger logic.

- Track Size Discussion:
  - Jared requested larger track.
  - Anthony explained current sizing is sufficient given new smoothing changes.

- Bot AI Plan (Anthony):
  - Bots answer on timers, randomly correct/incorrect to simulate players.
  - Configurable difficulty stats per bot (skill, reaction delay, accuracy, etc).
