==================================================

Meeting: Sprint Planning — Week 6
Date: Wednesday, November 5
Time: 3:00pm - 4:00pm
Location: In-Person

Attendees:
- Anthony
- Jared
- Noe
- Jefferson
- Elyas
Note: All members present!

==================================================

Agenda:
1. Discuss restructuring codebase into cleaner MVC-style architecture
2. Designate tasks for current sprint and assign responsibilities
3. Open floor for additional topics, questions, and blockers

==================================================

Discussion Notes:
- Reaffirmed previously agreed-upon restructuring of the codebase into a more MVC-aligned architecture.
- Controllers now own game logic (CarController, RaceController, etc.).
- Managers handle stateful logic and coordination (QuestionManager, QuestionStatsManager).
- Models define core data + game entities (car.ts, game-state.ts, etc.).
- Rendering/UI components moved under /rendering and /pages to keep them view-specific.
- Services handle external dependencies such as saving to localStorage.
- Tests reorganized to mirror folder structure for better maintainability.
- Discussed assignment of action items (Shown below).

==================================================

Sprint Objectives:
- Complete the transition toward a clearer MVC-style architecture, ensuring separation of concerns between
  models, controllers, managers, services, and rendering components.
- Deliver key gameplay improvements for Sprint 2: camera/car interaction fixes, collision refinement,
  minimap functionality, pit stop integration, and HUD updates.
- Ensure new features follow the updated directory conventions and include tests where appropriate.

Definition of Done:
- Code follows MVC structure (no rendering/UI logic inside controllers or models).
- Feature is functional, merged to main after PR approval, and passes automated tests.
- Test coverage updated for new logic or UI behavior changes (when applicable).
- No breaking regressions in existing gameplay (race starts, car movement, rendering pipeline, etc.).
