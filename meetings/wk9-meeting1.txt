==================================================

Standup Format:

Yesterday / Last Worked On:
- Jared: Closed out the last major UI refactor tasks, tuned streak/combo visuals for readability, and fixed a couple
  of minor layout bugs.
- Noe: Tightened fraction question generation (simplified some cases) and playtested campaign mode with real question
  pools.
- Anthony: Completed a major pass of [Sprint 3 / Task] Code review and refactor, removing dead code and clarifying
  controller logic.
- Eli: Adjusted Bot 1v1 flow based on feedback, ensuring it doesn’t stall the race and feels like a focused challenge.
- Jeff: Finished core Practice Mode flow, integrated car sprites and basic animations, and added more robust minimap
  tests.

Today / Working On Next:
- Jared: Focus on small polish fixes, reviewing any remaining PRs, and ensuring UI is consistent in the demo path.
- Noe: Run more end-to-end playtests to confirm campaign and fraction questions feel fair and bug-free.
- Anthony: Do targeted tweaks to bot behavior and physics after playtest feedback.
- Eli: Final polish on Bot 1v1 visuals, feedback, and balancing.
- Jeff: Do a final pass on Practice Mode and minimap clarity, then assist with documentation or demo setup.

Blockers / Needs Help:
- Jared: Wants sign-off from the team on the final UI look (menus + in-race HUD).
- Noe: Needs extra eyes on fraction question difficulty levels.
- Anthony: Needs the team to report any weird physics edge cases they find.
- Eli: Wants input on whether the minigame frequency feels right over a full race.
- Jeff: None at the moment; will help others if he finishes early.
