Meeting: Sprint 2 Retro (Follow-Up) + Sprint 3 Planning + Standup — Week 8
Date: Monday, November 17
Time: 6:20pm - 7:20pm
Location: Remote (Discord)

Attendees:
- Jared
- Noe
- Anthony
- Eli
- Jeff
Note: All members present!

==================================================

Agenda:
- Brief follow-up on outstanding Sprint 2 items
- Define Sprint 3 goals and scope
- Assign Sprint 3 stories/tasks
- Quick standup for current work and immediate next steps

==================================================

Sprint 2 Retro Follow-Up:
- Confirmed which Sprint 2 items are fully done vs. officially carried over:
  - Done: core physics fixes, UI refactor, campaign mode, pause-on-blur, initial pitstop overlay, HUD updates,
    race finish line, and basic minimap.
  - Carry-over:
    - Noe: [Sprint 2 / Task] Rework division question generation to accept fractions.
    - Eli: [Sprint 2 / Story 5] Bot 1v1 minigame (integration and gameplay tuning).
    - Jeff: [Sprint 2 / Story 2 / Task 2] Build tests for minimap rendering and extra minimap polish.
- Team agreed that carry-over work should be explicitly part of Sprint 3, not “side projects.”

==================================================

Sprint 3 Planning:

Goals for Sprint 3:
- Solidify the “feel” of the race: bots, minimap, HUD, and streak/combo feedback should feel responsive and readable.
- Introduce and refine Practice Mode as a lower-pressure on-ramp to the main game.
- Polish visual presentation with car sprites/animations and cohesive UI across menus and in-race screens.
- Improve test coverage for minimap, core HUD, and key gameplay flows.

Stories / Tasks (Initial Sprint 3 Setup):
- Anthony:
  - Continue bot AI refinement and overtake behavior tuning.
  - Conduct code review and refactor passes: [Sprint 3 / Task] Code review and refactor.
- Jared:
  - Sweep through remaining UI rough edges and align styles with final design decisions.
  - Ensure streak/combo visuals integrate cleanly with the HUD and don’t obscure gameplay.
- Noe:
  - Implement fraction support in division questions: [Sprint 2 / Task] Rework division question generation
    to accept fractions.
  - Tighten campaign pacing and difficulty curve if time allows.
- Eli:
  - Focus on [Sprint 2 / Story 5] Bot 1v1 minigame integration (when it triggers, how players/bots enter/exit,
    win/lose conditions, and feedback).
- Jeff:
  - Own [Sprint 3 / Story 3] Practice Mode implementation (simple race variant with tailored questions and
    lower-stakes environment).
  - Implement [Sprint 3 / Task] Car sprites and animations (both player and bot cars).
  - Finish [Sprint 2 / Story 2 / Task 2] Build tests for minimap rendering and clean up any minimap UX issues.

==================================================

Standup Snapshot (Sprint 3 Kickoff):

Yesterday / Last Worked On:
- Jared: Wrapped up most of the UI refactor and streak combo visual alignment.
- Noe: Finished core campaign mode structure and small polish items.
- Anthony: Stabilized physics tweaks and started documenting bot behavior.
- Eli: Iterated on pitstop 1v1 overlay and flow drafts.
- Jeff: Finished HUD updates, started planning Practice Mode and car sprite pipeline.

Today / Working On Next:
- Jared: Create Sprint 3 UI polish tickets and start work on high-visibility screens.
- Noe: Begin fraction question generation implementation and outline tests.
- Anthony: Begin Sprint 3 refactor passes and refine bot AI logic in the new structure.
- Eli: Break Bot 1v1 minigame into concrete subtasks and start with core gameplay loop.
- Jeff: Wire in Practice Mode flow (from main menu → practice race) and start integrating car sprites.

Blockers / Needs Help:
- Noe: Wants input on how complex fraction questions should be for target age range.
- Eli: Needs clarification on when Bot 1v1 should trigger (e.g., pitstop-only, mid-race events, etc.).
- Jeff: Needs agreement on final car sprite assets (size, orientation, and basic animation expectations).

==================================================

Action Items & Assignees:
- [ ] Anthony: Start [Sprint 3 / Task] Code review and refactor focusing on hot paths (race loop, bots, rendering).
- [ ] Jared: Open tickets for remaining UI polish and connect them to Sprint 3.
- [ ] Noe: Implement and test fraction-based division questions.
- [ ] Eli: Document the full Bot 1v1 minigame spec and share with the team for feedback.
- [ ] Jeff: Implement base Practice Mode flow and begin integrating car sprites and animations.
