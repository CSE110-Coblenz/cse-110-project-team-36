==================================================

Meeting: Standup — Week 8
Date: Wednesday, November 19
Time: 3:00pm - 4:00pm
Location: In-Person

Attendees:
- Jared
- Noe
- Anthony
- Eli
- Jeff
Note: All members present!

==================================================

Standup Format:

Yesterday / Last Worked On:
- Jared: Applied UI cleanup to menus and in-race HUD, reduced duplicated styling, and ensured streak/combo visual
  cues are visible but not overwhelming.
- Noe: Implemented first pass of fraction-based division questions and confirmed they appear correctly in the pool.
- Anthony: Started [Sprint 3 / Task] Code review and refactor, focusing on race controllers and physics helpers.
- Eli: Scoped out Bot 1v1 minigame flow and built a basic playable loop (entering minigame, answering, resolving).
- Jeff: Wired [Sprint 3 / Story 3] Practice Mode entry from the main menu and integrated basic car sprites for the
  player and bots.

Today / Working On Next:
- Jared: Finish remaining UI refactor edge cases and start reviewing others’ PRs for visual consistency.
- Noe: Add validation and edge-case handling for fraction questions; verify they don’t break streak/combo logic.
- Anthony: Continue refactor in areas that touch bots and collision logic; clean up naming and comments.
- Eli: Out from surgery.
- Jeff: Expand Practice Mode with clearer tutorial-esque copy and finalize the first pass of car animations.

Blockers / Needs Help:
- Jared: Wants feedback from the team on font sizing and spacing for the streak/combo overlay.
- Noe: Needs sample question sets from others to test fractions in “real” gameplay scenarios.
- Anthony: None currently, but may ask for help validating physics changes in playtests.
- Eli: Out from surgery.
- Jeff: Needs confirmation that car sprite sizes look okay across different devices/resolutions.

==================================================

Team Notes:
- We should start thinking about final demo flow: what we show first (menu → campaign → practice → main race).
- Encourage frequent playtesting this week so we don’t find UX issues at the last minute.
- Everyone should link PRs to sprint items so it’s easy to see progress on the board.
