==================================================

Standup Format:

Yesterday / Last Worked On:
- Jared: Continued work on [Sprint 2 / Task] UI components refactoring (cleaned up shared components, reduced prop
  bloat) and iterated on [Sprint 2 / Story 1] Streak/Combo Mode visuals. Helped review Anthony’s physics changes.
- Noe: Polished [Sprint 2 / Story 4] Campaign Mode flow (separate campaign button and basic progression), continued
  tuning track feel based on lap-time feedback, and wrapped up [Sprint 2 / Task] Pause the game when losing focus.
- Anthony: Finished most of the physics tasks: [Sprint 2 / Task] Fix camera onto car rotation, [Sprint 2 / Task]
  Fix collision physics when lane changing, and refinement of track smoothing. Started wiring pieces for bot behavior.
- Eli: Iterated on pitstop 1v1 minigame UX (overlay layout, bars, triggers) and aligned with track layout for possible
  [Sprint 2 / Story 5] Bot 1v1 minigame integration.
- Jeff: Updated HUD UI to match the latest designs, pushed progress on minimap renderer, and continued organizing the
  meetings/ folder plus standup notes.

Today / Working On Next:
- Jared: Push remaining [Sprint 2 / Task] UI components refactoring changes, finalize streak/combo visuals for player
  feedback, and prep PRs.
- Noe: Start on [Sprint 2 / Task] Rework division question generation to accept fractions if time allows, otherwise
  continue campaign polish and finish screen tweaks.
- Anthony: Focus on [Sprint 2 / Story 3 / Task 1] Build overtake logic and [Sprint 2 / Story 3 / Task 2] Build bot
  car AI logic (timers, correctness, difficulty profiles).
- Eli: Draft concrete plan for how [Sprint 2 / Story 5] Bot 1v1 minigame will integrate into the main race flow and
  continue implementation details for the pitstop overlay.
- Jeff: Finish [Sprint 2 / Story 2 / Task 2] Build tests for minimap rendering and polish [Sprint 2 / Task] Create
  race finish line / lap line on track behavior for multi-lap support.

==================================================

Team Notes:
- Goal is to keep Sprint 2 focused on core gameplay polish: physics, bots, minimap, campaign, and pitstop.
- PRs should stay small and targeted (one feature set per PR) to keep reviews manageable.
- Everyone should keep the board updated so we can see what’s at risk going into the next retro.
