Meeting: Sprint 3 Retrospective — Week 9
Date: Wednesday, November 26
Time: 3:00pm - 4:00pm
Location: Remote (Discord)

Attendees:
- Jared
- Noe
- Anthony
- Eli
- Jeff
Note: All members present!

==================================================

Agenda:
- Review Sprint 3 goals vs. what we shipped
- Discuss what went well and what could be improved
- Reflect on the project as a whole (across all sprints)
- Capture lessons learned for future team projects

==================================================

Sprint 3 Outcomes:

Highlights:
- Practice Mode (Jeff):
  - [Sprint 3 / Story 3] Practice Mode implemented as a friendly entry point into races.
  - Smooth flow from main menu into practice, focusing on learning without heavy penalties.
- Visuals & Presentation (Jeff):
  - [Sprint 3 / Task] Car sprites and animations added for both player and bot cars.
  - Overall race readability improved with minimap, HUD updates, and consistent art direction.
- Bots & Physics (Anthony):
  - Continued refinement of bot AI, overtake behavior, and physics tuning.
  - Major code cleanup completed via [Sprint 3 / Task] Code review and refactor.
- UI & Streaks (Jared):
  - UI components refactor completed; common components are cleaner and easier to reuse.
  - Streak/Combo Mode feels more rewarding without overwhelming the player visually.
- Campaign & Questions (Noe):
  - Campaign Mode tied together core gameplay beats with a structured progression.
  - Fraction-based division questions added, expanding question variety.
- Minigames & Docs (Eli):
  - Bot 1v1 minigame integrated in a way that complements the main race rather than derailing it.
  - README and project documentation updated so teammates and graders can understand and run the project.

==================================================

What Went Well:
- The game now feels like a coherent experience rather than a set of disconnected prototypes.
- Collaboration improved each sprint; fewer miscommunications and more async alignment via notes and board usage.
- The MVC-ish structure and refactors made it easier to reason about where new logic should live.
- Everyone owned visible, demo-able features (Practice Mode, bots, campaign, minigame, UI polish, etc.).

What Could Be Improved:
- Estimation: some features (like Bot 1v1, Practice Mode polish, and AI tuning) still took longer than expected.
- Testing: while coverage improved, tests were again most concentrated near the end of the sprint.

Project-Level Lessons Learned:
- Writing meeting notes and keeping a meetings/ directory actually helped future us remember decisions.
- Clear ownership per feature, but with review/backup from others, prevented work from getting stuck.
- Small, frequent PRs were significantly easier to manage than large “mega-PRs.”
- Planning concrete Definitions of Done at sprint start would have reduced ambiguity throughout.

==================================================

Action Items / Future Recommendations:
- Everyone: Reflect on which parts of this project they’d highlight on their resumes/portfolios and clean up
  branches or repos to make it easy to share.
