Note: All members present!

==================================================

Agenda:
- Review Sprint 2 commitments vs. completed work
- Identify what went well, what didn’t, and what to change
- Decide which items move into Sprint 3
- Capture process improvements for the next sprint

==================================================

Sprint 2 Outcomes:

Completed (Highlights):
- Anthony:
  - Finished core physics fixes: camera rotation, lane-change collision behavior, and track smoothing.
  - Contributed toward [Sprint 2 / Story 3] Bots & Competition with overtake logic and initial AI behavior.
- Jared:
  - Completed [Sprint 2 / Task] UI components refactoring (cleaner shared components, better prop usage).
  - Implemented [Sprint 2 / Story 1] Streak/Combo Mode and [Sprint 2 / Story 3 / Task 3] Wire in bot car settings
    with the race creation page.
- Noe:
  - Shipped [Sprint 2 / Story 4] Campaign Mode (basic structure + entry button) and [Sprint 2 / Task] Pause the game
    when losing focus on browser.
- Eli:
  - Built the first iteration of the pitstop minigame overlay, including progress bars and trigger logic.
  - Completed [Sprint 2 / Task] README Creation to document the project.
- Jeff:
  - Updated HUD UI to match the new visual direction.
  - Implemented race finish/lap line behavior and got the minimap renderer working at a basic level.

Partially Completed / Moving to Sprint 3:
- Anthony: Further refinement of bot AI difficulty profiles and long-race tuning.
- Jared: Additional UI polish for streak/combo effects and minor component cleanup.
- Noe: [Sprint 2 / Task] Rework division question generation to accept fractions.
- Eli: [Sprint 2 / Story 5] Bot 1v1 minigame integration into core race flow.
- Jeff: [Sprint 2 / Story 2 / Task 2] Build tests for minimap rendering and additional minimap polish.

==================================================

What Went Well:
- Clearer task breakdown (Stories vs. Tasks) helped everyone understand their responsibilities.
- Track physics and camera experience improved noticeably; playtests felt more “race-like.”
- Collaboration on UI/UX (HUD, campaign, pitstop) made the game feel more cohesive.
- Using the meetings/ folder + standup notes (Jeff) made it easier to remember decisions.

==================================================

Action Items & Follow-Ups:
- Anthony: Document a simple bot difficulty scheme (easy/medium/hard) with parameters to tune in Sprint 3.
- Jared: Create backlog items for any remaining UI polish work that didn’t fit into Sprint 2.
- Noe: Move fraction-based question generation task into Sprint 3 and outline test cases.
- Eli: Turn the Bot 1v1 minigame concept into a clear set of tasks (layout, triggers, integration).
- Jeff: Add minimap test coverage and ensure core race HUD elements are tested in Sprint 3.
