==================================================

Meeting: Playtesting & Demo Prep — Week 8
Date: Friday, November 21
Time: 5:30pm - 6:30pm
Location: Remote (Discord)

Attendees:
- Jared
- Noe
- Anthony
- Jeff
Note: Eli Out from surgery.

==================================================

Agenda:
- Run structured playtests of the current Formula Fun build
- Collect feedback on bots, minimap, Practice Mode, campaign, and UI
- Identify demo-blocking bugs and high-priority polish tasks
- Assign owners for fixes before Week 9

==================================================

Playtesting Notes (By Feature):

Bots & Physics (Anthony):
- Bots feel significantly more “alive” than in earlier sprints.
- Over-aggressive behavior in some corners; occasional weird lane-change moments.
- Difficulty curve between “easy” and “hard” bots is noticeable but could be tuned more.

UI & Streak/Combo (Jared):
- Streak/Combo indicators are readable and satisfying when triggered.
- In rare cases, combo text slightly competes with question text on smaller screens.
- Menu flow feels mostly smooth; only minor spacing issues on some resolutions.

Campaign & Questions (Noe):
- Campaign progression feels coherent (early races are manageable, later ones more challenging).
- Fraction-based division questions work but can feel a bit dense if too many appear in a row.
- No obvious crashes or soft-locks tied to specific question types.

Practice Mode, Minimap, Car Sprites (Jeff):
- Practice Mode is a good low-pressure entry point; players understood its purpose quickly.
- Minimap is helpful for seeing track position; some testers suggested slightly thicker or clearer car markers.
- Car sprites and basic animations make the race feel more “game-like” and polished.

Bot 1v1 Minigame (Eli):
- Out from surgery.

==================================================

Bugs / Issues Discovered:
- Occasional minor clipping when bots change lanes near tight turns.
- Rare UI overlap between streak text and question text on smaller window sizes.
- A couple of fraction questions generated edge cases (e.g., awkward mixed numbers) that felt out of scope.
- Minimap car icons can be slightly hard to see on very bright backgrounds.
- Bot 1v1 trigger frequency feels high in long races.

==================================================

Polish Tasks & Assignments:

- Anthony:
  - Tweak bot lane-change rules to avoid clipping in tight corners.
  - Slightly smooth acceleration/deceleration around sharp turns.

- Jared:
  - Adjust HUD layout to prevent streak/combo overlays from overlapping question text.
  - Double-check menu spacing and alignment at common resolutions.

- Noe:
  - Clamp fraction question difficulty (e.g., limit denominators) and remove the strangest edge cases.
  - Ensure question generation still plays nicely with streak/combo logic.

- Jeff:
  - Increase visibility of minimap car markers (size/shape tweaks).
  - Confirm car sprite scaling looks consistent across different aspect ratios.

- Eli:
  - Out from surgery.
